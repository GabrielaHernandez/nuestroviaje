					<h3>Karla's Bullying Story</h3>
					<p> In the year 2012, I was finally in the 4th grade.4th grade wasn't the best for me because I got bullied. Not bullied because of my body or even my unique traits but because of my race.For example,people would say “That's why you crossed the border” or even “shut up mexican” everytime I got into a argument with somebody else in the playground. I was so young,so I just ignored it but then the name calling got out of control.I started to feel offended.Discrimination is something that a person should go through , especially at a very young age.</p>

					<h3>Website's Solution</h3>
					<h5><strong>Bullying Resources:</strong></h5>
					<p>Bullying is possibly one of the biggest causes of depression. Furthermore being bullied because of your racist, gender, appearances, and sexual interests is more than likely to lower your self esteem. This website would be teens interacting with other teens unlike other websites where it’s teens talking to adults. There are times where not even adults can understand one’s issues and the only way for you to feel better is to talk to other teens who have faced or are facing the same problem as you.</p>					
					<p>Discrimination is also a problem that is very common due to the fact that there’s always going to be racism, in some shape or form, no matter where you go. For those who encounter problems such as this, the website let’s us get in contact with them and give them advice whenever they need it.</p>
