					<h3>Eliza's Immigrant Story</h3>
					<p>You know sometimes it can get hard not having papers. I was brought to the U.S. at the age 3 because my mom saw a better future for me there. We lived in my uncle’s house with his family which are legal. My mom worked really hard for me to have everything I needed. However she fell in love with my step-dad and so we moved together as a family with his daughter and two sons. At first he treated me well but then became so fake to me. I thought that I would actually have someone to care for me and call him my dad. I’m 13 and this immigration stuff gets to me every day. I just want to go back home with my real family. (I’m an only child if you were wondering)</p>
