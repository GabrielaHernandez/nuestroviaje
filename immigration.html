					<h3>Karla's Story</h3>
					<p>On December 6,2006, my life switched around, full of horror but also amazing thoughts. I remember the car broke down and everybody in the black  VW Golf 1.6 had to get out and run to the car next to us because at least 18 cop cars were chasing us. On our way to the United States, we had to stop in Los Angeles because the car broke down.I soon came to the United States, Afraid and excited, excited of the unexpected and afraid of the expected.When I finally arrived to the United States , the only thing I was thinking when I was in the car is “How am I gonna learn the language?”, “am I gonna get discriminated 
?”, “How will I make friends if I don’t speak english?” all these thoughts started running in my head all of sudden, Imagine how my mom would've felt at the moment with more worries than me.</p> <p>When I saw the green sign with the white letters saying “Welcome to New York” I hopeful. I felt like my dreams came true. It's the best feeling accomplishing something you never thought you would ever overcome.</p>
