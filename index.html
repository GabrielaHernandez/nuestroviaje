					<h3>Karla's Story</h3>
					<p>Many Young people come into the united states with big dreams so they could help their loved ones. I was one of the people who’s life changed dramatically. I was born on December 8,2001 in Mexico City, full of life and dreams that one day I will come to the United States and have a bright future. I was only 5, I had nothing to worry about. On the other hand, My mom had to worry about everything, how were gonna get there, all the dangers. My mother was a short,white,brown eyed,mess. She wasn’t prepared for the things we went through but she knew she had to make it work to keep my baby brother,older brother and I safe.</p>
