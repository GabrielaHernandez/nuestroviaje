					<h3>Karla's Story</h3>
					<p> In 2007-2008, I went to kindergarten in the bronx,I was so nervous, I didn't know what to expect.Kindergarten was hard work for me because I had to learn English. Everybody in my class didn't speak spanish and if they did I wouldn't understand them (we were 5! obviously).For Example, Every Time I had to go to the bathroom,I had to act it out because if I spoke spanish, they wouldn't understand me.Learning the language was definitely something that I still carry today because I speak english at school so I can communicate with my friends. 
</p>
					<h3>Website's Solution</h3>
					<h5><strong>Language Resources: </strong></h5>
					<p>One of the most common problems immigration teens face is language barriers, even if there are extra language classes. This website could benefit those who donâ€™t speak english fluently by putting it in the language that they understand, through methods such as google translate.
